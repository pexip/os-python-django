Description: High-level Python web development framework (Python 2 version)
 Django is a high-level web application framework that loosely follows the
 model-view-controller design pattern.
 .
 Python's equivalent to Ruby on Rails, Django lets you build complex
 data-driven websites quickly and easily - Django focuses on automating as much
 as possible and adhering to the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle.
 .
 Django additionally emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" of components;
 many generic third-party "applications" are available to enhance projects or
 to simply to reduce development time even further.
 .
 Notable features include:
  * An object-relational mapper (ORM)
  * Automatic admin interface
  * Elegant URL dispatcher
  * Form serialization and validation system
  * Templating system
  * Lightweight, standalone web server for development and testing
  * Internationalization support
  * Testing framework and client
 .
 This package is built for Python 2.
